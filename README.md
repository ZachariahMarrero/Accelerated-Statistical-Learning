# Accelerated-Statistical-Learning

Under construction...


This is a repository for materials I have developed to teach statsitical inference to beginners.  The premise of these materials is that statisticians and other experts often draw upon background knowledge and assumptions that their audiences are unaware of.  Thus, learning statistics as a beginner is confusing and decisions feel arbitrary.  My aim is to make the missing background knowledge explicit. For example, while I will not explain how to compute a mean, I will explain why we might prefer to use a mean instead of a median or mode for a given context. Additionally, the tools/resources will do so with the aide of modern computing software, namely R.  Along the way, I will both narrativize and code all concepts being careful to leave as few assumptions unaddressed as I'm able.  For example, early on I code and explain the differences between 'for loops', vectorized functions, and parallel processing.
